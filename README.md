This repository contains Verilog Code for a soft core microprocessor “NuCore” and its testbench named “NuCore_TB”.

Note: Instruction set and further instructions with detailed report is provided in the "Instruction_set+Details.pdf" file.
1.  The NuCore has the following major blocks.

    1.  A 64 deep Instruction Queue, addressed by a Program Counter. The
        Program Counter resets on the RESET signal. The Program Counter
        is incremented by one on each subsequent posedge of clock.

    2.  Instruction decode module: The instruction from the Instruction
        Queue Module is decoded according to the supported instruction
        format as given in Table below.

    3.  Two register files: REG_FILE_A (for keeping operands A) and
        REG_FILE_B (for keeping operands B). Both of these are 16 deep
        with a word size of 32

    4.  An Arithmetic Logic Unit that performs the arithmetic as defined
        by the instruction. The output of ALU is registered and goes
        directly as the output of NuCore. ALU also produces a registered
        ZERO FLAG that goes out as an output of “NuCore” module.

2.  The testbench “NuCore_TB” performs the following:

    1.  Provide the necessary interfacing signal, CLK and RESET and
        instantiate the NuCore.

    2.  The testbench should then perform the testing as follows:

	1.  Load the following set of instructions to the instruction
	    queue.

	2.  RESET

	3.  Store values of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 at locations
	    1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 of REG FILE A **iii.** Store values of
	    10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 at locations 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 of
	    REG FILE B

	4.  Add all the consecutive locations of REG FILE A & REG FILE B

	5.  Bitwise‐AND all the consecutive locations of REG FILE A &
	    REG FILE B
